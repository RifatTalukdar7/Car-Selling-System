# Car-Selling-System
Hereâ€™s a **short discussion** you can use in your GitHub README or project documentation for your **Car Selling System (Java, Console-based)**:

---

### **Project Overview**

The **Car Selling System** is a **Java console-based application** that manages cars, customers, and sales transactions. It allows users to add new cars, search available cars, register customers, and handle sales. The system is designed with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** to ensure modularity and reusability.

---

### **Key Features**

* **Add & Manage Cars**: Store details such as brand, model, year, price, and availability.
* **Search & Filter**: Look up cars by brand, price range, or status (Available/Sold).
* **Customer Management**: Register and store customer details.
* **Sales Handling**: Mark cars as sold, record customer purchases, and update availability.
* **Console-Driven Menu**: Simple text-based interface without GUI.

---

### **Design Approach**

* **Domain Classes**: `Car`, `Customer`, `Sale` represent core entities.
* **Services**: Separate classes handle car inventory, customer registration, and sales logic.
* **Repositories**: Data is stored in memory (using collections) or files for persistence.
* **Console Interaction**: Menu-driven program where users select options and input details directly via the terminal.

---

### **Learning Outcomes**

* Strengthened understanding of **Java OOP concepts** (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).
* Practical experience with **console-based user interaction**.
* Implementation of a **real-world simulation** for car sales workflow.
